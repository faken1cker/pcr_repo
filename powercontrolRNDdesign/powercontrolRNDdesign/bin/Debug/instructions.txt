                        POWERCONTROLRND PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

                                   *PLEASE NOTE*

1. START-UP (WELCOMING SCREEN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - When you launch the application, a welcoming window appears.
   - Click the "Start" button to continue.

2. AUTOMATIC RIG DETECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - After pressing "Start," the program checks the Windows registry key "type"
     to see if the rig is VCM100, VCM200, or RND320. If no PSU is connected
     a Warning pops up. 
   - It then adjusts channel names, default voltages, and other settings based
     on that detected rig.

3. MAIN CONTROL WINDOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Once the rig type is recognized, the main control window opens.
   - In this window you can:
     • Monitor voltage (V) and current (A) for each channel.
     • Adjust voltage/current on specific channels.
     • Power-cycle individual channels.

4. CHANNEL NAMES & BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Depending on the rig type:
     • VCM100 or VCM200 rigs may have multiple channels (1–4).
     • RND320 is single-channel; channels 2–4 show "N/A."
   - Each channel is labeled according to the rig type. 
   - For instance, if it's VCM100, you’ll see "VCM(CH1)" and "N/A(CH2)."

5. CHANGING VOLTAGE AND CURRENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Select the channel from the dropdown list (top-left side).
   - Enter the desired voltage (0–24 V) and current (0–5 A) in the text fields.
   - Click "Apply" to confirm and set these values on the PSU.

6. POWER CYCLING A CHANNEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Each channel row has a "Power Cycle" button.
   - To power cycle, simply press that button. The program will:
     • Turn the channel output off (allowing voltage to drop),
     • Then automatically turns it back on.

7. PSU TYPE & DEPLOYMENT STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - The main window shows two special labels:
     1) PSU Type: either "RND790" or "RND320," depending on your rig.
     2) Deployment Status: "Active (Read-Only)" or "Inactive (Read/Write)."
   - If Deployment is "Active," you can only monitor voltage/current—no changes
     or power cycles are allowed (to protect the PSU during deployment).
   - If "Inactive," you have full access to modify settings and power cycle.

8. CLOSING THE PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - When finished, close the main control window.
   - The program automatically disconnects from the PSU, ensuring it isn’t 
     left in a locked or connected state.
